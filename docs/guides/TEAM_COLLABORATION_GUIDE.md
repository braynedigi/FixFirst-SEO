## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Never Share Invitation Links**
   - Invitation links are personal and expire in 7 days
   - Each link is tied to a specific email address

2. **Regular Permission Audits**
   - Review team members quarterly
   - Remove access for inactive members
   - Use least-privilege principle (assign minimum required role)

3. **Protect Sensitive Data**
   - Limit OWNER and ADMIN roles
   - Use VIEWER role for stakeholders who only need visibility

### Team Collaboration

1. **Use Descriptive Comments**
   - Add context and details when commenting on issues
   - Tag team members when needed (coming soon)
   - Include resolution steps

2. **Track Activities**
   - Review activity feed regularly
   - Use statistics to identify active contributors
   - Monitor for unusual patterns

3. **Role Assignment Strategy**
   ```
   OWNER    ‚Üí Project lead / Product owner
   ADMIN    ‚Üí Development team leads
   MEMBER   ‚Üí Developers / SEO specialists
   VIEWER   ‚Üí Stakeholders / Clients
   ```

### Performance

1. **Activity Feed Pagination**
   - Use limit/offset for large projects
   - Default to 20-50 recent activities
   - Implement "Load More" for better UX

2. **Comment Loading**
   - Comments load on-demand (per issue)
   - Cache frequently accessed issues
   - Use optimistic UI updates

### Integration

1. **Webhooks (Coming Soon)**
   - Get notified when team members are added
   - Track comment activities
   - Monitor audit completions

2. **Slack Integration (Available)**
   - Configure Slack webhook in Settings
   - Receive notifications for:
     - Audit completions
     - Critical issues found
     - Team activities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Invitation Not Working**
- Check if invitation has expired (7-day limit)
- Verify email address is correct
- Ensure user is logged in before accepting

**2. Cannot See Comments**
- Verify you have access to the project
- Check if issue ID is correct
- Refresh the page

**3. Activity Feed Empty**
- Activities are logged automatically
- Check date range filter
- Verify you have access to the project

**4. Permission Denied Errors**
- Confirm your role and permissions
- Contact project owner for access upgrade
- Check if you were removed from project

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```typescript
localStorage.setItem('DEBUG_COLLABORATION', 'true');
```

View logs in browser console for detailed error information.

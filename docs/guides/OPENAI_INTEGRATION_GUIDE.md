---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. **Sign up** at [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
2. **Navigate** to [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. **Click** "Create new secret key"
4. **Copy** your API key (starts with `sk-...`)

### 2. Add to Environment Variables

**For development** (`apps/api/.env`):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
```

**For production** (VPS deployment):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Restart Your API Server

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run dev
```

You should see: `‚úÖ OpenAI service initialized`

### 4. Generate Recommendations

1. **Run an audit** on any project
2. **Open the audit** details page
3. **Click** the "Recommendations" tab
4. **Click** "Generate Recommendations"
5. **Expand** any recommendation to see detailed AI analysis!

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

The integration is designed to **minimize costs** while maximizing value:

### 1. **Uses GPT-3.5 Turbo** (Not GPT-4)
   - **~10-20x cheaper** than GPT-4
   - **Fast responses** (~2-5 seconds)
   - **Still highly capable** for SEO recommendations

### 2. **Batch Processing**
   - Processes **5 issues at a time** to avoid token limits
   - Reduces API calls by grouping related issues

### 3. **Deduplication**
   - **Groups identical issues** before sending to AI
   - Avoids generating the same recommendation twice

### 4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Recommendations are **stored in database**
   - **Won't regenerate** unless explicitly requested
   - Saves API calls on subsequent views

### 5. **Token Limits**
   - Max **2000 tokens per response** (~1500 words)
   - Keeps costs predictable per audit

### **Estimated Costs per Audit**

| Audit Size | API Calls | Estimated Cost |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Small (10-20 issues) | 2-4 | $0.01 - $0.03 |
| Medium (30-50 issues) | 6-10 | $0.03 - $0.07 |
| Large (100+ issues) | 20+ | $0.10 - $0.20 |

**Monthly estimate**: If you run 100 audits/month, expect **$5-15/month** in OpenAI costs.

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Security Headers Issue

**AI-Generated Recommendation:**

```
Title: Implement Critical Security Headers

Why This Matters:
Your website is missing HTTP security headers that protect against 
common vulnerabilities. These headers are essential for:
- HSTS: Prevents protocol downgrade attacks
- CSP: Protects against XSS and data injection
- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking
Search engines consider security a ranking factor.

How to Fix It:
1. For Nginx, add to server config:
   add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000"
   add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
2. For Node.js/Express, use helmet:
   npm install helmet
   app.use(helmet())
3. Test at: https://securityheaders.com
4. Aim for A+ rating

Code Examples:
// Node.js/Express
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());

Expected Impact:
‚úÖ Improve SEO rankings (Google rewards security)
‚úÖ Increase user trust
‚úÖ Reduce security vulnerabilities
‚úÖ Pass compliance audits
```

### Example 2: Meta Description Missing

**AI-Generated Recommendation:**

```
Title: Add Compelling Meta Descriptions

Why This Matters:
Meta descriptions appear in search results and significantly impact
click-through rates. Missing descriptions mean:
- Search engines generate poor auto-descriptions
- Lower CTR from search results
- Missed opportunity to showcase value

How to Fix It:
1. Add meta description tags to every page
2. Keep between 150-160 characters
3. Include target keywords naturally
4. Write compelling copy with a call-to-action
5. Make each description unique

Code Examples:
<!-- HTML -->
<meta name="description" content="Get professional SEO audits
that identify critical issues. Improve rankings with actionable
recommendations. Start your free audit today!">

<!-- React/Next.js -->
<Head>
  <meta name="description" content="Your description..." />
</Head>

Expected Impact:
‚úÖ 5-15% improvement in CTR from search results
‚úÖ Better rankings (improved engagement signals)
‚úÖ More qualified traffic
‚úÖ Lower bounce rates
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Change AI Model

Want to use **GPT-4** for higher quality recommendations?

Edit `apps/api/src/services/aiRecommendations.ts`:

```typescript
// Line ~150
const completion = await openai!.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4', // Changed from 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
  // ... rest of config
});
```

**Note**: GPT-4 costs **~10-20x more** than GPT-3.5 Turbo.

### Adjust Token Limits

To get more detailed recommendations, increase token limit:

```typescript
// Line ~155
const completion = await openai!.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
  max_tokens: 3000, // Increased from 2000
  // ... rest of config
});
```

**Note**: Higher tokens = higher costs per request.

### Change Batch Size

Process more/fewer issues per API call:

```typescript
// Line ~65 in aiRecommendations.ts
const batchSize = 10; // Changed from 5
```

**Larger batches**: Fewer API calls but higher token usage per call.  
**Smaller batches**: More API calls but lower token usage per call.

### Customize Temperature

Adjust AI creativity (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative):

```typescript
// Line ~154
temperature: 0.5, // Changed from 0.7 (more consistent)
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not provided" Warning

**Cause**: Environment variable not set.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check if variable is set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Set it in your .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# Restart API server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Recommendations Are Generic (Not AI-Powered)

**Cause**: OpenAI service failed to initialize.

**Fix**:
1. Check API server logs for errors
2. Verify API key is valid at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Check OpenAI account has credits available
4. Ensure no firewall blocking `api.openai.com`

### Issue: "Rate Limit Exceeded" Error

**Cause**: You've hit OpenAI's rate limits.

**Fix**:
1. **Free tier**: Very low limits (3 requests/min)
2. **Upgrade** to paid tier at [https://platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
3. Add $10-20 credits to start
4. Rate limits increase automatically with usage tier

### Issue: Recommendations Take Too Long

**Cause**: Processing many issues.

**Options**:
1. **Reduce batch size** (line 65 in `aiRecommendations.ts`)
2. **Use GPT-3.5 Turbo** instead of GPT-4
3. **Add loading indicators** to frontend (already implemented)

### Issue: OpenAI API Error

**Common errors and fixes:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Check API key is correct |
| 429 Rate Limit | Too many requests | Upgrade tier or wait |
| 500 Server Error | OpenAI downtime | Check status.openai.com |
| Timeout | Network issues | Retry or increase timeout |

---

## üé® Fallback Mode (Without OpenAI)

**The app works perfectly without OpenAI!** It will use:

‚úÖ **Template-based recommendations** with good SEO advice  
‚úÖ **Categorized by issue type** (Performance, Security, Content)  
‚úÖ **Prioritized by severity** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)  
‚úÖ **Basic code examples** for common issues  

**When to use fallback mode:**
- Don't want to pay for OpenAI
- Testing/development without API key
- OpenAI experiencing downtime
- Rate limit exceeded

---

## üìä Monitoring Costs

### Track Usage in OpenAI Dashboard

1. Visit [https://platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
2. View costs by:
   - **Day**: See daily spending
   - **Model**: GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
   - **Tokens**: Input vs output tokens

### Set Spending Limits

1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits)
2. Set **monthly budget cap**
3. Set **email alerts** at thresholds (50%, 75%, 90%)

### Estimate Your Costs

Use this formula:

```
Cost per Audit = (Avg Issues / Batch Size) √ó (Tokens per Batch / 1000) √ó Model Price

Example:
- Avg issues: 40
- Batch size: 5
- Batches: 40 / 5 = 8
- Tokens per batch: ~1500
- Total tokens: 8 √ó 1500 = 12,000
- GPT-3.5 price: $0.002 per 1K tokens
- Cost: 12 √ó $0.002 = $0.024 per audit
```

**100 audits/month = ~$2.40/month**

## 📊 Example: Before vs After

### Before (Basic Mode)
```
Title: Security Headers Missing
Description: Your site is missing security headers
Impact: This affects security
Effort: Medium
```

### After (AI-Powered Mode)
```
Title: Implement Critical Security Headers

Why This Matters:
Your website is missing HTTP security headers that protect against 
common vulnerabilities. These headers are essential for:
- HSTS: Prevents protocol downgrade attacks and ensures HTTPS
- CSP: Protects against XSS and data injection attacks
- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME-sniffing
Search engines like Google consider security a ranking factor.

How to Fix It:
1. For Nginx servers, add to your server configuration
2. For Apache servers, add to your .htaccess  
3. For Node.js/Express, use the helmet middleware:
   - Run: npm install helmet
   - Add to server: app.use(helmet())
4. Test at: https://securityheaders.com
5. Aim for an A+ rating
6. Monitor regularly with automated checks

Code Examples:
// Nginx Configuration
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;

// Node.js/Express with Helmet
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());

Expected Impact:
✅ Improve SEO Rankings - Google rewards secure sites
✅ Increase User Trust - Browsers mark your site as secure
✅ Protect User Data - Prevent XSS, clickjacking, MITM attacks
✅ Pass Security Audits - Meet industry standards
✅ Reduce Bounce Rate - Users feel safer on secure sites
```

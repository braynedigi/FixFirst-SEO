## 🏗️ Architecture

### Files Created/Modified:

#### 1. **Email Service** (`apps/api/src/services/email-service.ts`)
- Nodemailer integration
- SMTP configuration with fallback to console logging
- Three main methods:
  - `sendAuditCompleteEmail()`
  - `sendAuditFailedEmail()`
  - `sendWelcomeEmail()`
- Beautiful HTML templates with dark theme
- Auto-generated plain text fallback

#### 2. **Worker Integration** (`apps/api/src/worker.ts`)
- Checks user notification preferences
- Sends audit complete/failed emails
- Non-blocking email sending
- Fetches user email from project ownership

#### 3. **Auth Routes** (`apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`)
- Sends welcome email on registration
- Non-blocking to not delay registration response

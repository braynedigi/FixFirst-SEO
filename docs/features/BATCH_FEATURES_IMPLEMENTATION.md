  actionUrl   String?
  status      NotificationStatus @default(UNREAD)
  priority    NotificationPriority @default(NORMAL)
  metadata    Json               @default("{}")
  readAt      DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime           @default(now())
}

model NotificationRule {
  id          String              @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  projectId   String?
  name        String
  event       String              // Event to trigger on
  conditions  Json                // Conditions to check
  channels    NotificationChannel[] // How to notify
  enabled     Boolean             @default(true)
}
```

**Notification Service:**
- Located in `apps/api/src/services/notificationService.ts`
- Supports multi-channel delivery (IN_APP, EMAIL, SLACK, WEBHOOK)
- Rule engine with condition evaluation
- Bulk notifications for team members
- Auto-cleanup of old notifications
- Priority determination logic

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/notifications` - List notifications

- `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Archive notification
- `GET /api/notifications/rules` - List notification rules
- `POST /api/notifications/rules` - Create rule

   - Checks custom notification rules
   - Determines priority based on score
   
2. **Team Notifications:**
   - Notifies all project members
   - Respects notification preferences
   - Multi-channel delivery

#### Priority Logic:
```typescript
- Score >= 80: LOW priority

- Score < 40: URGENT priority
```

#### Notification Channels:
- **IN_APP**: Browser notification center
- **EMAIL**: HTML email with priority styling
- **SLACK**: Slack webhook integration
- **WEBHOOK**: Custom webhook triggers

#### Custom Notification Rules:
Users can create custom alert rules with:
- **Event Selection**: Choose which events trigger notifications
- **Conditions**: Define when to notify (e.g., score < 50)
- **Operators**: eq, ne, gt, lt, gte, lte, contains
- **Multi-Channel**: Notify via multiple channels
- **Project-Specific**: Rules per project or global

**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Time Invested:** 3-4 hours  
**Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

#### What It Does:
Complete webhook delivery system that allows users to receive real-time notifications when audit events occur.

- `webhook.test` - Test event for webhook validation

#### Technical Implementation:

**Database Model:**
```prisma
model Webhook {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  projectId   String?
  url         String
  events      String[] // Event subscriptions
  enabled     Boolean  @default(true)
  secret      String?  // For signature verification
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  project     Project? @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

**Webhook Service:**
- Located in `apps/api/src/services/webhookService.ts`
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- HMAC SHA-256 signature generation
- Parallel webhook delivery
- Error handling and logging

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/webhooks` - List all webhooks (filtered by project)
- `POST /api/webhooks` - Create new webhook
- `PUT /api/webhooks/:id` - Update webhook
- `DELETE /api/webhooks/:id` - Delete webhook
- `POST /api/webhooks/:id/test` - Send test webhook

**Webhook Payload Structure:**
```json
{
  "event": "audit.completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "auditId": "cmh9...",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "projectId": "proj123",
    "totalScore": 85,
    "categoryScores": {
      "technical": 90,
      "onPage": 85,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Security:**
- Optional secret key per webhook
- HMAC SHA-256 signature in `X-Webhook-Signature` header
- Format: `sha256=<hex_digest>`
- Verify signature on receiving end for security

#### Integration Points:
1. **Worker Integration:**
   - Triggers webhooks on audit completion
   - Triggers webhooks on audit failure
   - Graceful failure handling (doesn't affect audit status)

2. **Frontend API:**
   - Complete API client in `apps/web/lib/api.ts`
   - Ready for UI implementation

#### Usage Example:

**Create a Webhook:**
```bash
POST /api/webhooks
{
  "projectId": "proj123",
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/seo",
  "events": ["audit.completed", "audit.failed"],
  "secret": "your-secret-key"
}
```

**Verify Webhook Signature (Node.js):**
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify(payload));
  const expected = `sha256=${hmac.digest('hex')}`;
  return signature === expected;
}
```

- ✅ `apps/api/src/server.ts` (Modified - added routes)
- ✅ `apps/api/src/worker.ts` (Modified - added triggers)
- ✅ `apps/web/lib/api.ts` (Modified - added API client)
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` (Modified - already had Webhook model)

### Database Schema

```prisma
model User {
  ...
  twoFactorEnabled        Boolean   @default(false)
  twoFactorSecret         String?   // BASE32 encoded TOTP secret
  twoFactorBackupCodes    String?   // JSON array of hashed backup codes
  ...
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Store Backup Codes Securely**
   - Use a password manager
   - Keep a printed copy in a safe place
   - Never share them with anyone

2. **Use a Trusted Authenticator App**
   - Google Authenticator
   - Authy
   - 1Password
   - Microsoft Authenticator

3. **Enable 2FA for Important Accounts**
   - Especially for admin accounts
   - Accounts with sensitive data access

4. **Regenerate Backup Codes if Compromised**
   - If you suspect codes have been exposed
   - After using several backup codes

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid verification token" Error
- Check that your device time is synchronized
- Try generating a new code
- Verify you're entering the code within the 30-second window

### Lost Access to Authenticator App
- Use one of your backup codes to log in
- Once logged in, disable and re-enable 2FA with a new device

### Backup Codes Not Working
- Ensure you're entering the code exactly as shown (with or without hyphens)
- Each backup code can only be used once
- If all codes are used, you'll need account recovery assistance

## Migration Guide

If you have existing users, they will need to:
1. Log in with their current credentials (2FA not yet required)
2. Navigate to Profile ‚Üí Security
3. Enable 2FA following the setup wizard
